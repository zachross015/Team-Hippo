## User Experience Requirements

Our original user stories encompassed a variety of accessibility issues. Although this is an ongoing development in its own right, we needed to come up with user stories that were more general and stayed true to our original goal of finding ways to maintain attention in hybrid synchronous settings. Our original decisions for user stories were the following:

1. As a teacher, I would like to have a tool which maintains the attention of all my students.
2. As a student with dyslexia, I would like to have speech-to-text and text-to-speech options for learning and completing my assignments.
3. As a student with ADHD, I would like to learn a concept with distraction free content. 
4. As a student with a visual impairment, I would like options for managing the text size, text contrast, and magnification of text in online applications.
5. As a student with an audio impairment, I would like options for adding visual cues to audio-intensive activities.

From here, we narrowed down our user stories a bit. We first noticed that dyslexia and visual impairments can be expanded to encompass visual impairments as a generality. In both cases of our user stories we included solutions to the user stories rather than stating what it might be that those users wanted. We then decided to go with the user stories for the teacher, the ADHD student, and the visually impaired student. 

The reason we decided on the teacher was to explore how attention issues may affect them. This choice was guided by the critique in our rubric:

> However, what other groups of individuals can be affected by the stated problems? how about instructors? 

The ADHD student was chosen since they can have the most difficulty in holding attention for the longest periods of time. This presents a unique problem wiht regards to our issue, and so we felt it was most fitting to explore this. 

The visually impaired student was chosen so we could explore the alternative accessibility options that should be necessary when designing a hybrid, synchronous learning experience. Although there are numerous solutions out there for enabling their participation (zoom, for instance, provides many tools necessary for this as is shown in https://zoom.us/accessibility), we wanted to explore what alternatives we could come up with in regards to our platform.

This narrowed down the stories to:

1. As a teacher, I would like to have a tool which maintains the attentions of all my students.
2. As a student with ADHD, I would like to learn a concept in a distraction-free setting 
3. As a student with a visual impairment, I would like to have accessible methods for interacting with my classwork.

## Ideation and Preliminary Design

For our user stories, we used Mural to come up with a set of ideas as a group. This mural is shown below. On the left, the yellow stickies denote our user stories. Each green/blue sticky is used to denote a solution to the user story on that row, with the solutions we agreed to be the best colored blue.

We decided these solutions as they all are components of a cohesive, hybrid-synchronous, classroom experience, and we felt that these solutions/features would provide the best experience for users of our proposed solution from Milestone 2: Classroom Gamification.

Using these solutions, we made our low-fidelity wireframes.

### Wireframe for "Provide Team Quiz or Team Trivia opportunities (Online Learning)"

### Wireframes for "Gamification of classwork would allow active involvement and increase overall attention" and "Implement badge reward based on student's favorite animal, game etc"

### Wireframe for "Speech-to-text and text-to-speech options for learning and completing my assignments"

### Wireframe for "Provide accessibility features such as increase in font size, customized color contrast, large print captions, and magnification"

### High Fidelity Mockup

After creating all of the low-fidelity wireframes, we decided that Jane's design for the Gamification platform would suit us the best since it provides a more light-hearted and distraction-free approach to an online classroom. So our high-fidelity mockup takes inspiration from her design and creates a flow between the different user stories which encapsulates all the solutions we had discussed as a group. 

Of the solutions we chose for the user stories, the best solutions were decided to be the following for the respective user stories (as defined above):

1. Provide Team Quiz or Team Trivia opportunities (Online Learning). This was decided as it provides the best tool for the teacher with regards to active attention. This kind of platform, with the way we designed it, fosters both a cooperative and competitive atmosphere, allowing students to communicate with each other and debate solutions based on what they believe to be right.
2. Gamification of classwork would allow active involvement and increase overall attention. This one most aligns with our original proposed solution and helps ADHD students by providing a dynamic learning environment where they feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for completing their activities.
3. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech options for learning and completing my assignments. We chose this solution to be the best due to it being a status-quo for accessibility solutions in visually impaired students. Although this one was harder to show in a wireframe, so throughout the high-fidelity mockup, we included a button in almost every menu which indicates a text to speech option.
