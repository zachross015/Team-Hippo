## User Experience Requirements

Our original user stories encompassed a variety of accessibility issues. Although this is an ongoing development in its own right, we needed to come up with user stories that were more general and stayed true to our original goal of finding ways to maintain attention in hybrid synchronous settings. Our original decisions for user stories were the following:

1. As a teacher, I would like to have a tool which maintains the attention of all my students.
2. As a student with dyslexia, I would like to have speech-to-text and text-to-speech options for learning and completing my assignments.
3. As a student with ADHD, I would like to learn a concept with distraction free content. 
4. As a student with a visual impairment, I would like options for managing the text size, text contrast, and magnification of text in online applications.
5. As a student with an audio impairment, I would like options for adding visual cues to audio-intensive activities.

From here, we narrowed down our user stories a bit. We first noticed that dyslexia and visual impairments can be expanded to encompass visual impairments as a generality. In both cases of our user stories we included solutions to the user stories rather than stating what it might be that those users wanted. We then decided to go with the user stories for the teacher, the ADHD student, and the visually impaired student. 

The reason we decided on the teacher was to explore how attention issues may affect them. This choice was guided by the critique in our rubric:

> However, what other groups of individuals can be affected by the stated problems? how about instructors? 

The ADHD student was chosen since they can have the most difficulty in holding attention for the longest periods of time. This presents a unique problem wiht regards to our issue, and so we felt it was most fitting to explore this. 

The visually impaired student was chosen so we could explore the alternative accessibility options that should be necessary when designing a hybrid, synchronous learning experience. Although there are numerous solutions out there for enabling their participation (zoom, for instance, provides many tools necessary for this as is shown in https://zoom.us/accessibility), we wanted to explore what alternatives we could come up with in regards to our platform.

This narrowed down the stories to:

1. As a teacher, I would like to have a tool which maintains the attentions of all my students.
2. As a student with ADHD, I would like to learn a concept in a distraction-free setting 
3. As a student with a visual impairment, I would like to have accessible methods for interacting with my classwork.
