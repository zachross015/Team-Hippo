## Introduction

Teaching/ Learning in person or online should be aimed to reach every student. For in-person teaching, adequate provisions are provided to accommodate most students needs. Evidently it’s not achieved over night and the structure we have right now is a culmination of many years of effort by administration to provide resources to encourage them in their pursuit of education.Shifting to online learning has posed many difficulties. Despite many efforts by teachers and administration, teachers and students have faced situations we were not prepared for or equipped to solve. At times, the frustration of accommodating to the setting and overcoming these challenges discouraged students to learn. This is much more significant for people with physical and learning disabilities. Many of these difficulties, our group has faced this year. So, we took this opportunity to look deep into possible solutions, resources and strategies to solve these issues at least partly. We believe our research is important in providing equal opportunity to all students in hybrid-learning setting where people with different constraints  can reach their maximum potential. Loosing focus is a significant issue for the students and teachers equally. We have observed professors providing extra resources to make things easier and being available as much as possible to help us, but still the issues persist. Since monitoring student’s concentration levels during an online session is highly impossible.

### User population affected 

Issue can be as simple as the type of font used, students with Dyslexia will struggle getting through the topic. Students with Dysgraphia who find it hard to convert their thoughts into writing, finds it hard to reach out to teachers during an online session.  Students with Dyscalculia who has difficulty with math and numbers are finding these courses extremely hard to get through. Students with Auditory Processing Disorder, suffer from hearing sounds. A member of our group talked about how he/she found it difficult to express. Students with Visual perceptual/ visual motor disabilities loose track of the text when looking at screens. These issues might seem small but these issues were exaggerated in the online setting. It’s demotivating and disheartening to be in this position.

### Significance of our study

We believe by addressing this issue, we can increase the awareness of existing issues and possibly pool resources from various sources and help students in the future for better participation and successful academic experience despite the setting for learning.

## Existing Solutions

The existing solutions in this area are a bit lackluster at the moment. Because the *necessity* of hybrid learning has just come about through the last year, the amount of studies done on methods in this domain are just not beginning to grow. More focus on this subject has come about, yet it is still too early in the development of these studies for many existing solutions exist.

One existing solution studied by ![Chih-Ming Chen and Jung-Ying Wang](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10494820.2017.1341938) is monitoring students' attention and alerting the student with an alarm should their attention wander. Although the results provided show that they undoubtedly increase the amount of sustained attention, the method requires a specialized headset used for monitoring brainwaves for their results. This is not an accessible method for sustaining attention in the general public because of the cost of such a device alone, which breaks Golden Rule 2. Moreover, it would be concerning how the presence of an alarm affects the students general behavior. This is something that could be further studied.

Another existing solution is to utilize Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) as a means of making the classroom more active. This would be a great step for those with ADHD and ADD, as the interactivity aids in their understanding. Still, the accessibility of technology is limited until that kind of technology is more affordable. This is all discussed in detail in ![Synchronous virtual classroom for student with ADHD disorder](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7748860).

Taking all this into account, we propose some guidelines and cautions for the development of technologies that aid in virtual classroom settings:

**Guidelines**

- Technologies should be cheap or provided by the teaching institution
- Technologies or teachers should positively reinforce sustained attention
- VR and AR should be utilized for providing interactivity to lessons and creating virtual environments

**Cautions**

- Relying solely on technology can be inaccessible
- Utilizing VR and AR have numerous inaccessibility cases that must be taken into account when building applications around them

## Proposed Solution

In order to hold and keep learner’s/students' attention, certain approaches are
proposed here.

As a caution to reduce more dependency on technology and provide a solution that
is accessible to both students and teachers, we would be proposing the solution
below.

### Active Learning

**Properties**: One of the most successful ways of learning has been incorporating
active learning into classroom settings especially in hybrid settings. This has
proven to be successful and applicable to all age groups. Active learning includes
any approach that encourages students to participate in classes through meaningful
activities, yet a lot of hybrid settings have failed to incorporate the active learning
into the classroom. According to this research which suggests that students in
traditional lecture-style courses, without active learning, are 1.5 times more likely
to fail than students who are in courses that include active learning elements.

Examples of active learning that can be applied to hybrid settings and prove
effective are.

- Large group, Discussion.
- Self-assessment.
- Informal groups.
- Groups Evaluation
- Peer review.
- Interactive lecture.
- Positive retrospective meeting (game or simulation).

This can potentially be facilitated through technology like screen sharing and live
streaming technology.

### Gamification.

Even though the concept of gamification is not a new thing in the world of
education, it offers a lot of promising impact to hybrid learning.

**Properties**: Games have proven to be addictive to both children and adults, so the
idea of game-based hybrid learning would improve the level of engagement in
students, especially students with special needs. Gamification in learning involves
using game-based elements such as point scoring, peer competition, teamwork,
score tables to drive engagement, help students assimilate new information and test
their knowledge.

Teachers can implement gamification in several ways. Examples of game
components that can be used in a mixed classroom are:

* Instant feedback.
* Progress indicator.
* Narrative.
* Social connection.
* Player control.

Gamification offers a lot of benefits to the classroom and learning outcome as a
whole, some of the benefits are:

* Ownership of learning
* More fun in the classroom.
* Increase in concentration level.

To determine if the above solution was a success a clear change in the way students
are involved in a hybrid environment should be examined. With these solutions,
teachers are able to monitor students’ engagement in real-time and make necessary
adjustments if need be.
