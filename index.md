# Addressing Attention Issues in Hybrid Learning

## Introduction

## Existing Solutions

The existing solutions in this area are a bit lackluster at the moment. Because the *necessity* of hybrid learning has just come about through the last year, the amount of studies done on methods in this domain are just not beginning to grow. More focus on this subject has come about, yet it is still too early in the development of these studies for many existing solutions exist.

One existing solution studied by ![Chih-Ming Chen and Jung-Ying Wang](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10494820.2017.1341938) is monitoring students' attention and alerting the student with an alarm should their attention wander. Although the results provided show that they undoubtedly increase the amount of sustained attention, the method requires a specialized headset used for monitoring brainwaves for their results. This is not an accessible method for sustaining attention in the general public because of the cost of such a device alone, which breaks Golden Rule 2. Moreover, it would be concerning how the presence of an alarm affects the students general behavior. This is something that could be further studied.

Another existing solution is to utilize Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) as a means of making the classroom more active. This would be a great step for those with ADHD and ADD, as the interactivity aids in their understanding. Still, the accessibility of technology is limited until that kind of technology is more affordable. This is all discussed in detail in ![Synchronous virtual classroom for student with ADHD disorder](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7748860).

Taking all this into account, we propose some guidelines and cautions for the development of technologies that aid in virtual classroom settings:

**Guidelines**

- Technologies should be cheap or provided by the teaching institution
- Technologies or teachers should positively reinforce sustained attention
- VR and AR should be utilized for providing interactivity to lessons and creating virtual environments

**Cautions**

- Relying solely on technology can be inaccessible
- Utilizing VR and AR have numerous inaccessibility cases that must be taken into account when building applications around them
