## Testing Protocol

> A user testing protocol describes the objective(s), methodology, and organization of a user test; it essentially describes how to administer a user test and how the data can be used to answer your research question. For this part of the milestone, you should describe your protocol by answering the following questions:
>	-	What is your research question? It should be simple, falsifiable, and related to the effectiveness of your design in solving your problem of study.
>
>	-	Based on your research question, what methodology will you use for testing and why? Some examples include:
>	    -	Observation / Participant Observation.
>	    -	Surveys.
>	    -	Interviews.
>	    -	Focus Groups.
>	    -	Experiments.
>	    -	Secondary Data Analysis / Archival Study.
>	    -	Mixed Methods (combination of some of the above)

Answer: Testing Protocols 

**Research question 1.** As a teacher, how can I use real time quiz to estimate student participation?

- Methodology
  - Surveys: I believe teacher satisfaction survey regarding the effectiveness of real time quizzes will give insights into wether it is a useful task and what additional changes we can make to address the issue or identify instructors expectations.
  - Interviews: Interviewing instructors from various courses can help custom real time quiz functionality. For example, instructors from statistics class might need more data related quizzes, instructors from more theory oriented classes might prefer small answer questions etc.,

**Research question 2.** As a student, how can I use gamification to better understand a concept?

- Methodology
	- Participant Observation: Students interaction with gamification facility can be evaluated by seeing usage of the gamification and by conducting knowledge evaluation metric either by a quiz, or test of some sort. We can also provide restricted access to gamification facility to observe how students understanding of a certain topic is dependent on gamification.
	- Surveys: By conducting student surveys, we can collect more information regarding existing status of the gamification functionality. Along with evaluation we can estimate potential improvements that can be included. 
	- Focus groups: Since one of the main groups of people we aimed to help with this feature is people with ADD or ADHD, we can form a focus group of people who have cognitive learning disabilities and ask for their opinion or provide an experimental ground for them to get acquainted with the feature. This will demonstrate if gamification serves our intended purpose.
	- Archival Study: Recently experiments are done in employing gamification feature for better understanding of a concept and help students with learning disabilities. We can derive our inspiration or get a direction in what to consider before designing the app. We believe this will also provide us a broader view of the problem at hand and better customize our feature to address different groups of people.

**Research Question 3.** As a student with Visual and/or Auditory disability, can I navigate through course site options effectively?

- Methodology
	- Interviews: By interviewing people who have used the functionality will give a good look into how effective our speech-to-text and text-to-speech is. Interviewing individuals with visual disabilities will give an insight into how easy it is to access the text-to-speech feature and how effective it is in navigating the website and how effective our feature is in submitting assignments. One of the important things we wanted to observe is how accent of the participants is interpreted by our system. This is particularly important because we want to help students from various backgrounds. 
	- Surveys: Surveying people depending on their user interaction with the feature is a good way to estimate the effectiveness fo our feature.
	- Focus groups: Forming focus groups of students with Visual/Audio disabilities in testing the prototype of the feature gives an in depth knowledge of potential changes that can be made or identify faults with the existing feature. Working closely with a focus group will also provide a look at ease of access with our feature.

> Based on the methodology you chose in (B.1), describe your **testing procedure**.

	1. Manage the test
		1. Create the test specification
		1. Perform test execution
		1. Test report
		1. Test delivery
	1. Consider employee and project deadlines
	1. Estimate the project execution time
	1. Be mindful of any project risks being taken
8. Test Deliverables

> Regardless of methodology, your testing procedure needs to involve your design prototype from (A). Also, be sure to incorporate answers to the following questions in your description.
> - What is your specific plan to deal with informed consent?

Verbally summarize all the crucial parts of the testandprovide a more detailed form for testers to sign.

> - What specific data will you collect and how will it be organized?

Audience reactions, website interactions, and thoughts on our ideas via a feedback tool to help facilitate hybrid learning into a more effective and equal opportunity environment.

> - What type of analysis do you intend to perform withthe studydata, and how will that analysis help answer yourresearchquestion from (B.1)?

Use either the Agile or Waterfall Methodology (Lean Six Sigma?)

> - How might you conduct your testing procedure safely during apandemic?

Our methodology uses hybrid protocols to begin with, meaning most of the study can be performed from monitoring user interactions with the platform. That being said, any in person study would have dedicated space fitted out with safety measures for prevention of disease spreading.
